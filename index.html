        <h3><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/nissan-surges-on-report-japan-group-may-seek-tesla-investment">Nissan Motor Co. shares jumped after the Financial Times reported that a high-level Japanese group 
          has drawn up plans to seek investment from Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. to aid the struggling carmaker.</a></h3>
        <p>The group believes the electric vehicle maker is interested in acquiring Nissan’s plants in the US, the newspaper reported, citing people it didn’t identify. The proposal envisions a
           consortium of investors, with Tesla as the largest backer, but also includes the possibility of a minority investment by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. to prevent a full takeover by the Apple supplier, the report said.</p>
